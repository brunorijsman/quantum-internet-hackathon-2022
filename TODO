TODO Add counters for:
     - How many quantum bits
     - How many quantum gates
     - How many steps in the circuit
     - How many classical message transfers
     - Etc.

TODO Put all QNE ADK related code in its own subdirectory

TODO Mention that instead of resetting qubits we can also perform an X operation controlled by
     a classical measurement result

TODO Start preparing
     - Writeup blog
     - Powerpoint slides
     - Video perhaps?

TODO Add references
