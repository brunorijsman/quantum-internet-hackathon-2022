# RIPE Labs Quantum Internet Hackathon 2022

The
[Réseaux IP Européens (RIPE) Network Coordination Center (NCC)](https://www.ripe.net/)
is co-organizing the
[Quantum Internet Hackathon (QIH) 2022](https://labs.ripe.net/author/karla-white/take-part-in-the-quantum-internet-hackathon-2022/)
on 1 and 2 December 2022.

# Project proposal: Distributed Quantum Fourier Transformation

This Git repository contains a proposal for a QIH2022 project:
to implement a distributed version of the Quantum Fourier Transformation (QFT) on two different
simulation platforms, namely Qiskit and QNE-ADK.

# The Quantum Fourier Transformation (QFT)

The quantum Fourier transformation is an important building block in many quantum computing
algorithms including factoring prime numbers using Shor's algorithm and phase estimation.

There are numerous resources that describe the quantum Fourier transformation and its applications,
including:

 * Several sections in the [Qiskit textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook)

   * [Section 3.5: Quantum Fourier Transformation.](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-fourier-transform.html)

   * [Section 3.6: Quantum Phase Estimation.](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/quantum-phase-estimation.html)

   * [Section 3.7: Shor's Algorithm.](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/shor.html)
 
 * [The Wikipedia article on the quantum Fourier transform.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Fourier_transform)

 * Chapter 5 "The quantum Fourier transformation and its applications" in the book
   [Quantum Computation and Quantum Information](https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Computation-Information-10th-Anniversary/dp/1107002176).
